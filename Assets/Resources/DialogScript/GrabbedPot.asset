  - Woohoo, good job. We're half way there!
  - Now let's see what "Existing For Morons" has to say about opening pots.
  - '"When objects are in your hand, you can interact with them still!"'
  - '"If you click your left mouse button, you might be surprised at what happens!"'

  - '"Alternatively if you don''t want to hold an object anymore, '
