  - Yo, listen!
  - Kid, kid I'm talking to you.
  - Yeah you with the blank face and the dumb outfit.
  - My name is Ivan!
  - I don't know where I am. I can tell from the smell of this place
  - that YOU must've moved my home.
  - Didn't your mother ever tell you to not, pick up random pots
  - and take them with you?
  - Whatever, just let me out of here so I can move my house back to
  - where it is supposed to be!
