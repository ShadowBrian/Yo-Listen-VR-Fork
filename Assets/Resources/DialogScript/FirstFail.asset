  - Hey, loser!
  - Did you think dying would get rid of me?
  - Well... TOO BAD!
  - I learned time magic last week!
  - Do you know what that means?
  - I can keep blowing you up... FOREVER!
  - My magic isn't the best, though.
  - DO NOT go and move things around.
  - If you do, it'll take me a while to reset everything back.
  - So why don't you just sit back and enjoy purgatory haha..
