  - ...
  - Wow, kid. That was so pathetic.
  - Like I honestly feel bad for you.
  - You would rather try to escape than protect your home?
  - I can't believe you would try and take the easy way out.
  - I'm really disappointed in you.
  - Like, very disappointed.
  - I'm going to kill you again, but you should really think about
  - how badly you messed up.
  - Alright, see you soon.
